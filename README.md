## Blackjack 
This project simulates a basic Blackjack game using Python. Cards are randomly dealt to the user and the computer, and a winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## Features
- Random card drawing
- User and computer compete to get the highest score without exceeding 21
- Blackjack check and score comparison
  
## Installation
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

```bash
python Blackjack.py
```
## Usage
Once the game starts, you'll be asked if you want to play a game of Blackjack. Press 'y' to begin, and two cards will be dealt to you. The goal is to have your cards' total value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Each round, you can decide whether to draw another card or pass. The computer will play automatically based on its own set of rules.

## Game Rules
- Both players start with two cards.
- The user can choose to draw additional cards or pass.
- The computer will draw cards until its score is 17 or higher.
- A player wins automatically if they get a Blackjack (21 points).
- Going over 21 results in a loss.
